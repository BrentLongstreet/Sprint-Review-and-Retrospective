# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

I interpret the user needs and implement them into a program by having consistent and effective communication with the users. Conducting focus groups as a Product Owner helped provide a better understanding of the user's needs. I was able to determine the implementations they desired and forward the information to the rest of the team by adding the user stories to the backlog. Creating user stories helped with interpreting and implementing the user's wants/needs into the program by adding the user stories to the backlog so the developers would be able to seamlessly infer the desired implementations.

# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

Throughout this software development life cycle course, I have learned about the agile approach to software development. In the future, I intend to incorporate the agile methodology throughout the lifecycle of programs I develop. An agile method is a nonlinear approach to software development that allows the team to be flexible and open to changes. An agile process I hope to incorporate into my future development work is affinity grouping. Affinity grouping breaks down and sorts the developmental steps by size/length based on estimations.  This method helps separate the work into more manageable pieces and provides the team with an estimated time the project will be completed in.

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

A good team member in software development is someone who is well-rounded and knowledgeable about the software development life cycle. It is important for team members to be involved with the rest of the team and conduct productive discourse. A good team member provides constructive feedback that will help the team deliver a superior product. Additionally, a team member should be motivated and actively build relationships within the team to enhance the work environment.
